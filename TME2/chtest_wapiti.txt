Confidence
in
the
pound
is
widely
expected
to
take
another
sharp
dive
if
trade
figures
for
September
,
due
for
release
tomorrow
,
fail
to
show
a
substantial
improvement
from
July
and
August
's
near-record
deficits
.
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
Nigel
Lawson
's
restated
commitment
to
a
firm
monetary
policy
has
helped
to
prevent
a
freefall
in
sterling
over
the
past
week
.
But
analysts
reckon
underlying
support
for
sterling
has
been
eroded
by
the
chancellor
's
failure
to
announce
any
new
policy
measures
in
his
Mansion
House
speech
last
Thursday
.
This
has
increased
the
risk
of
the
government
being
forced
to
increase
base
rates
to
16
%
from
their
current
15
%
level
to
defend
the
pound
,
economists
and
foreign
exchange
market
analysts
say
.
``
The
risks
for
sterling
of
a
bad
trade
figure
are
very
heavily
on
the
down
side
,
''
said
Chris
Dillow
,
senior
U.K.
economist
at
Nomura
Research
Institute
.
``
If
there
is
another
bad
trade
number
,
there
could
be
an
awful
lot
of
pressure
,
''
noted
Simon
Briscoe
,
U.K.
economist
for
Midland
Montagu
,
a
unit
of
Midland
Bank
PLC
.
Forecasts
for
the
trade
figures
range
widely
,
but
few
economists
expect
the
data
to
show
a
very
marked
improvement
from
the
#
2
billion
-LRB-
$
3.2
billion
-RRB-
deficit
in
the
current
account
reported
for
August
.
The
August
deficit
and
the
#
2.2
billion
gap
registered
in
July
are
topped
only
by
the
#
2.3
billion
deficit
of
October
1988
.
Sanjay
Joshi
,
European
economist
at
Baring
Brothers
&
Co.
,
said
there
is
no
sign
that
Britain
's
manufacturing
industry
is
transforming
itself
to
boost
exports
.
At
the
same
time
,
he
remains
fairly
pessimistic
about
the
outlook
for
imports
,
given
continued
high
consumer
and
capital
goods
inflows
.
He
reckons
the
current
account
deficit
will
narrow
to
only
#
1.8
billion
in
September
.
However
,
Mr.
Dillow
said
he
believes
that
a
reduction
in
raw
material
stockbuilding
by
industry
could
lead
to
a
sharp
drop
in
imports
.
Combined
with
at
least
some
rebound
in
exports
after
August
's
unexpected
decline
,
the
deficit
could
narrow
to
as
little
as
#
1.3
billion
.
Mr.
Briscoe
,
who
also
forecasts
a
#
1.3
billion
current
account
gap
,
warns
that
even
if
the
trade
figures
are
bullish
for
sterling
,
the
currency
wo
n't
advance
much
because
investors
will
want
to
see
further
evidence
of
the
turnaround
before
adjusting
positions
.
Nevertheless
,
he
noted
,
``
No
one
will
want
to
go
into
the
trade
figures
without
a
flat
position
''
in
the
pound
.
Meanwhile
,
overall
evidence
on
the
economy
remains
fairly
clouded
.
In
his
Mansion
House
speech
,
Mr.
Lawson
warned
that
a
further
slowdown
can
be
expected
as
the
impact
of
the
last
rise
in
interest
rates
earlier
this
month
takes
effect
.
U.K.
base
rates
are
at
their
highest
level
in
eight
years
.
But
consumer
expenditure
data
released
Friday
do
n't
suggest
that
the
U.K.
economy
is
slowing
that
quickly
.
The
figures
show
that
spending
rose
0.1
%
in
the
third
quarter
from
the
second
quarter
and
was
up
3.8
%
from
a
year
ago
.
This
compares
with
a
1.6
%
rise
in
the
second
from
the
first
quarter
and
a
5.4
%
increase
from
the
second
quarter
of
1988
.
Mr.
Dillow
said
the
data
show
the
economy
``
is
still
quite
strong
,
''
but
suggestions
that
much
of
the
spending
went
on
services
rather
than
consumer
goods
should
reduce
fears
of
more
import
rises
.
Certainly
,
the
chancellor
has
made
it
clear
that
he
is
prepared
to
increase
interest
rates
again
if
necessary
to
both
ensure
that
a
substantial
slowdown
does
take
place
and
that
sterling
does
n't
decline
further
.
Thursday
,
he
reminded
his
audience
that
the
government
``
can
not
allow
the
necessary
rigor
of
monetary
policy
to
be
undermined
by
exchange
rate
weakness
.
''
Analysts
agree
there
is
little
holding
sterling
firm
at
the
moment
other
than
Mr.
Lawson
's
promise
that
rates
will
be
pushed
higher
if
necessary
.
And
,
they
warn
,
any
further
drop
in
the
government
's
popularity
could
swiftly
make
this
promise
sound
hollow
.
Sterling
was
already
showing
some
signs
of
a
lack
of
confidence
in
Mr.
Lawson
's
promise
Friday
.
In
European
trading
it
declined
to
$
1.5890
and
2.9495
marks
from
$
1.5940
and
2.9429
marks
late
Thursday
.
Economists
suggested
that
if
the
pound
falls
much
below
2.90
marks
,
the
government
will
be
forced
to
increase
rates
to
16
%
,
both
to
halt
any
further
decline
and
ensure
that
the
balance
of
monetary
policy
remains
unchanged
.
Friday
's
Market
Activity
The
dollar
posted
gains
in
quiet
trading
as
concerns
about
equities
abated
.
Foreign
exchange
dealers
said
that
the
currency
market
has
begun
to
distance
itself
from
the
volatile
stock
exchange
,
which
has
preoccupied
the
market
since
Oct.
13
,
when
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
plunged
more
than
190
points
.
Currency
analysts
predict
that
in
the
coming
week
the
foreign
exchange
market
will
shift
its
focus
back
to
economic
fundamentals
,
keeping
a
close
eye
out
for
any
signs
of
monetary
easing
by
U.S.
Federal
Reserve
.
Late
in
the
New
York
trading
day
,
the
dollar
was
quoted
at
1.8578
marks
,
up
from
1.8470
marks
late
Thursday
in
New
York
.
The
U.S.
currency
was
also
changing
hands
at
142.43
yen
,
up
from
141.70
yen
in
New

late
Thursday
.
In
Tokyo
on
Monday
,
the
U.S.
currency
opened
for
trading
at
141.95
yen
,
up
from
Friday
's
Tokyo
close

40

In
an

East

the

Freight
rates
,
declining
for
most
of
the
decade
because
of
competition
spurred
by
deregulation
,
are
bottoming
out
,
turning
upward
and
threatening
to
fuel
inflation
.
Trucking
,
shipping
and
air-freight
companies
have
announced
rate
increases
,
scheduled
for
this
fall
or
early
next
year
,
reflecting
higher
costs
and
tightened
demand
for
freight
transport
.
Major
shippers
say
they
expect
freight
rates
to
rise
at
least
as
fast
as
inflation
and
maybe
faster
in
the
next
few
years
.
That
's
a
big
change
from
recent
years
when
freight
haulage
was
a
bright
spot
for
U.S.
productivity
,
helping
to
restrain
inflation
and
make
U.S.
industry
more
competitive
abroad
.
``
Demand
has
caught
up
with
the
supply
of
certain
types
of
freight
transportation
,
and
rates
are
starting
to
move
up
''
at
a
rate
``
close
to
or
slightly
more
than
the
inflation
rate
,
''
said
Clifford
Sayre
,
director
of
logistics
at
Du
Pont
Co
.
Shippers
surveyed
recently
by
Ohio
State
University
said
they
expect
their
freight-transport
,
storage
and
distribution
costs
to
rise
about
4
%
this
year
.
Only
10
%
of
the
250
shippers
polled
expected
their
freight-transport
costs
to
decrease
,
compared
with
30
%
who
had
looked
to
freight
transport
to
reduce
costs
in
past
years
.
``
This
is
the
first
year
since
transportation
deregulation
in
1980
that
we
have
had
such
a
dramatic
and
broad-based
upturn
in
perceived
transportation
rates
,
''
said
Bernard
LaLonde
,
a
transportation
logistics
professor
at
Ohio
State
in
Columbus
.
The
deregulation
of
railroads
and
trucking
companies
that
began
in
1980
enabled
shippers
to
bargain
for
transportation
.
Carriers
could
use
their
equipment
more
efficiently
,
leading
to
overcapacity
they
were
eager
to
fill
.
Shippers
cut
about
$
35
billion
from
their
annual
,
inter-city
truck
and
rail
costs
,
to
about
$
150
billion
,
or
about
6.4
%
of
gross
national
product
,
down
from
8
%
of
GNP
in
1981
.
But
with
much
of
the
inefficiency
squeezed
out
of
the
freight-transport
system
,
rising
costs
are
likely
to
be
reflected
directly
in
higher
freight
rates
.
``
Shippers
are
saying
`
the
party
's
over
,
'
''
said
Mr.
LaLonde
.
``
Shippers
wo
n't
be
able
to
look
for
transportation-cost
savings
as
they
have
for
the
last
eight
or
nine
years
.
Transport
rates
wo
n't
be
an
opportunity
for
offsetting
cost
increases
in
other
segments
of
the
economy
.
''
Robert
Delaney
,
a
consultant
at
Arthur
D.
Little
Inc.
,
Cambridge
,
Mass.
,
said
``
We
've
gotten
all
the
benefits
of
deregulation
in
freight-cost
reductions
.
Now
we
are
starting
to
see
real
freight-rate
increases
as
carriers
replace
equipment
,
pay
higher
fuel
costs
and
pay
more
for
labor
.
You
'll
see
carriers
try
to
recoup
some
of
the
price
cutting
that
occurred
previously
.
''
Not
everyone
believes
that
the
good
times
are
over
for
shippers
.
``
There
's
still
a
lot
of
pressure
on
rates
in
both
rail
and
truck
,
''
said
Gerard
McCullough
,
lecturer
in
transportation
at
Massachusetts
Institute
of
Technology
.
Less-than-truckload
companies
,
which
carry
the
freight
of
several
shippers
in
each
truck
trailer
,
discounted
away
a
4.7
%
rate
increase
implemented
last
April
.
The
carriers
were
competing
fiercely
for
market
share
.
Railroad-rate
increases
are
likely
to
be
restrained
by
weakening
rail-traffic
levels
and
keen
competition
for
freight
from
trucks
.
An
official
at
Consolidated
Freightways
Inc.
,
a
Menlo
Park
,
Calif.
,
less-than-truckload
carrier
,
said
rate
discounting
in
that
industry
has
begun
to
``
stabilize
.
''
Consolidated
Freightways
plans
to
raise
its
rates
5.3
%
late
this
year
or
early
next
year
,
and
at
least
two
competitors
have
announced
similar
increases
.
